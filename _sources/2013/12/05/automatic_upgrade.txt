automatic upgrade
=================

Sometimes you would like to configure your ubuntu host to upgrade automatically without any manual intervention.

You can achieve this by unattended-upgrades package.  Here is a short memo to do so.

Install unattended-upgrades package (if not there).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades

Enable automatic upgrade.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades

You will be prompted and see message like this.

.. code-block:: bash

    Applying updates on a frequent basis is an important part of keeping systems secure. By default, updates need to be applied manually using package management tools. Alternatively, you can choose to have this system automatically download and install security updates. 
    Automatically download and install stable updates? 

After enabling unattended-upgrades, you will have configuration like this.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ more /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
    APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
    APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";

According to history records yielded in /var/log/apt/history.log, it seems that automatic update may take place around 08:00.

.. code-block:: bash
