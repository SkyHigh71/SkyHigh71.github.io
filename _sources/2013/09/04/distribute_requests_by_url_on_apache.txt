distribute requests by URL on apache
====================================

what's in your mind?
--------------------

Suppose that you have contents built on sphinx. 
And you have already deployed it on apache instance.

Suppose that you would like to deploy another content.
That is, you started blogging and would like to publish it on identical instance of apache.

You can configure apache instance so that it distributes content by given URL.

Let's get started
-----------------

You can create symbolic link to target directory under documentation root directory though, it seems to be quite raw. 
You can make use of "LocationMatch" directive.

Create configuration file, e.g. tinker.conf under /etc/httpd/conf.d directory so that httpd can evaluate request.

.. code-block:: apache

    Alias /blog <TINKER_ROOT>/blog/html/
    <LocationMatch "/blog/.*">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "Open Sesame!"
        AuthUserFile <PATH_TO_PASS>/htpasswd
        Require user lupin
    </LocationMatch>

All request for <SERVER>/blog/* will be routed to contents under <TINKER_ROOT>/blog/html directory.
Replace <TINKER_ROOT> and <PATH_TO_PASS> as appropriate to meet your environment.

In this sample, we apply basic authentication for access to this content.
And user "lupin" can view content if authentication succeeds.

Create password file for lupin by htpasswd command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ htpasswd -c htpasswd lupin

If you would like to allow access for other users, then add accounts to user list.
You can append user names by separating them with white space.

.. code-block:: apache

        Require user lupin fujiko jigen

And restart httpd so as to reflect changes above.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo service httpd restart

**Enjoy!**
