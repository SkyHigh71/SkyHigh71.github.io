compare files recursively
=========================

I have to confess that I'm so ignorant... 

You can compare all the files under 2 directories recursively by diff command with -r option.

For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ diff -r <DIR_A> <DIR_B>

So easy.
sigh...

.. author:: default
.. categories:: none
.. tags:: command
.. comments::
