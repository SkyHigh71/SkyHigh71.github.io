USB devices
===========

Sometimes you would like to reference USB devices, which are attached to your machine.
You can make use of lsusb utility for this sake.

For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ lsusb
    Bus 002 Device 003: ID 5986:0299 Acer, Inc 
    Bus 004 Device 002: ID 0a5c:21f4 Broadcom Corp. 
    Bus 006 Device 008: ID 0bb4:0ffe HTC (High Tech Computer Corp.) Desire HD (modem mode)

In case that you would like to check further details of specific USB device, for example, Desire, then you can specify use verbose option, -v.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo lsusb -v -s 008

By the way, lsusb command accesses file under /dev/bus/usb directory, which requires root permission.
Therefore if you execute command as user other than root without sudo, then you will see open failure.

.. code-block:: c

    open("/dev/bus/usb/006/008", O_RDWR)    = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
