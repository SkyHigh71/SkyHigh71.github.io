copy intermediate directories
=============================

Sometimes you would like to cp files under directories, which does not exist on target directory. Current cp command does support this kind of operation.

Suppose that you have a file, which contains list of files with directory. You can copy files in it, for example, as follows.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir <TARGER_DIR>
    $ while read LINE
    > do
    > cp -p --parents $LINE <TAGET_DIR>
    > done < <INPUT_FILE>

You will see that directory strctures are automatically created under target directory.

So easy...

Please refer to `gnu page`_ for details.
