static IP address assignment
============================

Let us configure network related properties of our DNS Server host.

hostname 
--------

hostname of host can be configured by editing /etc/hostname file.

static IP address
-----------------

By default, hosts are configured to obtain IP address from DHCP Server.
Configuration is stored in /etc/network/interfaces file.

.. code-block:: bash

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet dhcp

Replace above as follows so that IP address 10.0.3.10 is statically assigned for interface eth0.

.. code-block:: bash

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.0.3.10
    network 10.0.3.0
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    broadcast 10.0.3.255
    gateway 10.0.3.1

resolver
--------

As advertised in it, /etc/resolv.conf file will be overwritten upon system reboot.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
    #     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN

You need to configure IP addresses of DNS servers and search domain in /etc/network/interfaces file as well.

.. code-block:: bash

    dns-search example.org
    dns-nameservers 10.0.3.10 10.0.3.1 8.8.8.8

Resolver will generates such lines as follows in /etc/resolv.conf.

.. code-block:: bash

    nameserver 10.0.3.10
    nameserver 10.0.3.1
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    search example.org
