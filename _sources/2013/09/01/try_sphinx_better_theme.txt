try sphinx better theme
=======================

Found a `new theme`_ for sphinx.

.. _new theme: https://github.com/irskep/sphinx-better-theme

`Demo site`_ looks nice & simple.

.. _Demo site: https://sphinx-better-theme.readthedocs.org/en/latest/demos.html

Let's apply and see what kind of effect will have on my documentation.

Application procedure is quite simple.
Install sphinx-better-theme package.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install sphinx-better-theme

Apply theme by modifying conf.py.

.. code-block:: python

    from better import better_theme_path
    html_theme_path = [better_theme_path]
    html_theme = 'better'

Ok, stay with this theme.
