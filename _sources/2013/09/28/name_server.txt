Name Server
===========

Now let's move on to Name Server.
Sometimes you would like to have your own name services to manipulate protocol like SMTP.

I hereby demonstrate procedure to set up BIND (version 9).
In this example, we use fictitious domain, example.org.

We disregard redundancy and focus on primary server. 
That is, we omit secondary server :-).

By the way, following articles are good reference for you.

- `Redhat Doc`_
- `Ubuntu Doc`_

.. _Redhat Doc: http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/ch-bind.html
.. _Ubuntu Doc: https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/dns.html

In this sample, we Ubuntu as platform.
And goal is to setup instance as follows.

.. nwdiag:: net.diag


Installation
------------

Installation is quite simple.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install bind9 dnsutils

That's all.

Server Configurations
---------------------

Configuration files are stored under /etc/bind directory.
You will modify some file and add zone files for forward/reverse lookup.

.. code-block:: bash

    ├── bind.keys
    ├── db.0
    ├── db.127
    ├── db.255
    ├── db.empty
    ├── db.local
    ├── db.root
    ├── named.conf
    ├── named.conf.default-zones
    ├── named.conf.local
    ├── named.conf.options
    ├── rndc.key
    └── zones.rfc1918

Forward Zone
------------

Append following lines into named.conf.local file so as to specify your domain name and its zone file.

.. code-block:: nginx

    zone "example.org" {
	    type master;
        file "/etc/bind/db.example.org";
    };

Create zone file, db.example.org, so as to describe host in the domain.

.. literalinclude:: db.example.org 
    :language: bash


Reverse Zone
------------

And now configure for reverse lookup.
Same as forward lookup, append following lines into named.conf.local.file.

.. code-block:: nginx

    zone "3.0.10.in-addr.arpa" {
            type master;
            file "/etc/bind/db.10";
    };

And create a file named db.10 as follows.

.. literalinclude:: db.10
    :language: bash

Logging
-------

Log message has been and will be your friend for debugging problem.
Append following lines to named.conf.local file.

.. code-block:: nginx

    logging {
        channel query.log {      
            file "/var/log/query.log"; 
            severity debug 3; 
        }; 
        category queries { query.log; }; 
    };

And create a log file and change file owner to bind user.

.. code-block:: nginx

    $ sudo touch /var/log/query.log
    $ sudo chown bind /var/log/query.log

You will see log messages like this.

.. code-block:: bash

    client 127.0.0.1#34060 (mta.example.org): query: mta.example.org IN A +E (127.0.0.1)

start service
-------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo service bind9 restart
