password lock of screensaver
============================

By default, gnome-screen runs on ubuntu and password lock is enabled.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ps -ef|grep -i screen
    lupin   2000     1  0 15:44 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver --no-daemon

Sometimes you may feel password lock troublesome and would like to disable it.
You can achieve it by gsettings command.

Current configuration can be checked,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled
    true

You can disable password lock by setting lock-enabled value as false,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver lock-enabled false

Checking system calls done by this command, screensaver configuration seems to be stored in,

- /run/user/<UID>/dconf/user (may be for running process)
- /<HOME>/.config/dconf/user (for permanent configuration)

You can lock screen by "CTRL" + "ALT" + "L".
