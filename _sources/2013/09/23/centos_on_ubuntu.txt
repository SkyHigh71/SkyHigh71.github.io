CentOC on ubuntu
================

Ok, let us create a Redhat clone instance, say, cent OS on ubuntu.
So as to manipulate RPM packages, you need to install curl and yum package.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install curl yum

By default, there is no lxc template for Cent OS.
You need to deploy lxc template manually. 
For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo wget -O /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-centos https://gist.github.com/hagix9/3514296/raw/7f6bb4e291fad1dad59a49a5c02f78642bb99a45/lxc-centos

You need some adjustment in case that architecture of you machine is i686.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ arch
    i686
    $ diff /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-centos /usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-centos.org 
    170,171c170
    <         #RELEASE_URL="$MIRROR_URL/Packages/centos-release-$release-$releaseminor.el6.centos.10.$arch.rpm"
    <         RELEASE_URL="$MIRROR_URL/Packages/centos-release-$release-$releaseminor.el6.centos.10.i686.rpm"
    ---
    >         RELEASE_URL="$MIRROR_URL/Packages/centos-release-$release-$releaseminor.el6.centos.10.$arch.rpm"

Ok, now you are ready to start instance creation.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo lxc-create -t centos -n centos01

Please be noted that first time execution may take time, as this will download substantial amount of PRM packages.

After successful creation of instance, you can launch it and login via ssh.
By the way, default root password is password.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo lxc-start -n centos01 -d
    $ ssh -l root `cut -d " " -f3 /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.lxcbr0.leases`
