lxc continued
=============

Let us create virtual machine of your choice.
Suppose that you would like to create an instance of ubuntu.
(Please do not ask me reason why I need to run ubuntu on unbutu :-)).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n ubuntu01

As this command execution will download files, therefore first time execution may take time.
So please wait for a while, say, by drinking coffee.

After successful execution, you will have an ubuntu instance named "ubuntu01".

Ok, let us start lxc as daemon.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo lxc-start -n ubuntu01 -d

According to dhcp server (dnsmasq), 10.0.3.198 may have been leased.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.lxcbr0.leases 
    1379835957 00:16:3e:08:50:7f 10.0.3.198 ubuntu01 *

Let us login via ssh.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh -l ubuntu 10.0.3.198

Therefore network plan would be like this.

.. nwdiag:: net.diag
