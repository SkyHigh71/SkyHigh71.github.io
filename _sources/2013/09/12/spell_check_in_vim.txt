spell check in vim
==================

If my memory does not deceive me, I started using vi as my editor on HP-UX 10. 
(Yes, it is quite long time ago)
I have not noticed it until quite recently though, vim (vi improved) has evolved so much more than I had expected.

I write almost all of text on vim, which includes this blog post.
As seen, my vocabulary is quite limited and incorrect. And phrase does not go beyond routine.
That is, I need spell checking mechanism to correct many typo I make and suggestions to meet what I want to express.

spell check
-----------

vim provides spell checking mechanism and you can enable it by:

.. code-block:: vim

    :set spell

You will see color indicators, which tells you that there is typo.
You can list correct word candidates by setting cursor on the relevant word and

.. code-block:: vim

    z=

You will see list of words. Select appropriate one out of them.

dictionary extension
--------------------

You can add words, which are not listed in default dictionary into your own custom one.
Type zg(ood) on the relevant word.

.. code-block:: vim

    zg

This operation simply adds that word into spellfile, e.g.) en.utf-8.add file under ~/.vim/spell directory.

.. code-block:: vim

    $ cat en.utf-8.add
    vim

If you would like to revert back, then type zw(rong).

.. code-block:: vim

    zw

It seems that vim appends "/!" for that word in spell file.

.. code-block:: vim

    $ cat en.utf-8.add
    vim/!
