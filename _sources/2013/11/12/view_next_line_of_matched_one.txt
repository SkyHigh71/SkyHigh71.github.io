view next line of matched word
==============================

You sometimes would like to show the very next line(s), which contain specific word(s).

I have to confess that I did not know there is a useful option in grep to achieve this sake...
I have been using, say, some script to extract lines, which I would like to check.

You can achieve this with -A option.
For example, if you would like to show the next line, which contains specific word, then following command give you the answer:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ grep <WORD> -A 1 <FILE>

If you would like to see more line(s), increase argument after -A option.

So easy...

.. author:: default
.. categories:: none
.. tags:: grep
.. comments::
