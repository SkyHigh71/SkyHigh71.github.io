root your android
=================

Sometimes you would like to obtain root privilege on android device.
For example, in case that you install applications, which requires root privilege (e.g. bash).

I hereby share with you a quick procedure to do so.

Please be note that unlocking boot loader will lose warrant of your device.
I remind you that this procedure shall be done totally under your own risk :-)

backup
------

You have to backup your precious data of device before you start.
Take your time so that you will not lose your treasure.

unlock boot loader
------------------

Shutdown your device and boot into boot loader mode by pressing "-" button upon start-up.
And then connect android device to your ubuntu and execute following command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo fastboot oem unlock

This command execution will unlock boot loader.
And lock state will change from "locked" to "unlocked".

install root application
------------------------

Download CFA-Auto-Root package, which matches your device and install it.

For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fastboot boot image/CF-Auto-Root-<device_name>-nakasi-nexus<*>.img 

install application
-------------------

Now your android device is capable of allowing applications to have root privilege.

For example I have installed following applications (some do not require root) to manipulate android. 

- terminal emulator
- BusyBox
- hacker keyboard
- bash
- vim_touch

Fine.
Now I can play with my android any time I want!
