==================================

Sometime you would like to mount Windows File System from ubuntu so that you are able to Windows files by making use of command line tools of linux.

You can access via CIFS and here is a quick procedure to do so.

Create share

Create File Share on on Windows side, which is the target of reference.
You can check share properties by.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ net share <shareName>

CIFS utility
------------

Then install tools necessary for mounting with CIFS on ubuntu side.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install cifs-utils

mount
-----

Create mount point.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir -p /windows/server1

Prepare password file for authentication, say, named "passwd" under ~/cifs directory with content as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    username=<MS_UID>
    password=<MS_PASSWD>

Add following line in /etc/fstab so that one can mount shared folder from ubuntu

.. code-block:: bash

    //<MS_HOST>/<ShareName>  /windows/server1  cifs credentials=<HOME>/cifs/passwd,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm  0  0
