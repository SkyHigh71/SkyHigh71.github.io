resize disk size of guest on KVM
================================

Sometimes you regret that you created guest OS with too small disk space. 
sigh...
And you would like to increase disk space a little.

You can do it with some steps and I hereby quote a sample procedure of such operation.
In this sample, OS of guest instance is Windows 7.

shutdown
--------

Shutdown guest OS before start operation.

resize image file
-----------------

Guest OS's file system is represented in image file (\*.img), which reflect its size.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ du -sh /var/lib/libvirt/images/win7.img
    21G	/var/lib/libvirt/images/win7.img

Let us manipulate image file by qemu-img command.
In this sample, 20GB will be added to existing file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo qemu-img resize /var/lib/libvirt/images/win7.img +20G
    Image resized.

resize partition
----------------

Now you need to resize existing partition to grow as much as you increased.
For that sake, let us make use of `gnome partition editor`_ (gparted).

.. _gnome partition editor: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/

Download ISO file of gparted and connect it to guest instance.
And boot from gparted.
You will select graphical user interface of gparted and increase partition size easily.

boot
----

Now you can boot with guest OS and see that disk size does increase.
