plotting
========

Sometimes you would like to create a plot out of some text file.
You can achieve it by making use of matplotlib.

I have to confess that I am not quite accustomed with matplotlib though, I hereby demonstrate a sample.

installation
------------

Installation is quite simple and one line command suffices.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

sample
------

Suppose such a CSV file as follows.

.. literalinclude:: sample.csv
    :lines: 1-3

That is, CSV file contains residential loan prepayment history.
lines are consisted of,

- month of prepayment
- monthly payment
- bonus payment

plot
----

You can plot a graph, for example, as follows.

.. literalinclude:: plot.py

.. image:: sample.png
