insert characters in multiple lines
===================================

Sometime you would like to insert same characters into multiple lines.
I have to confess that I've been using sed command to achieve this, say,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sed -e "s/^/> /g" in.txt > out.txt

You can do the same within vim.

- press ctrl + v
- press shift + i (I)
- input character(s) of your choice
- press esc

So easy...
