caching content on nginx
========================

You can cache content on front-end reverse proxy so as to provide content more effectively for requests and reduce traffic against back-end web server.

Let us get started.

nginx.conf
----------

Key point here is that you should insert cache configuration line before includes so that it should be evaluated beforehand.

.. code-block:: nginx

    http {

        ##
        # cache config
        ##
        proxy_cache_path /tmp/nginx/cache levels=1 keys_zone=wiki:4m inactive=1h max_size=10m;

        include /etc/nginx/conf.d/\*.conf;
        include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\*;
    }

With this configuration,

- actual cache files are stored under /tmp/nginx/cache directory with hierarchy of one

.. code-block:: bash

    /tmp/nginx/cache
    ├── 0
    │   └── 64b08f8ec9459d892a1a80bea5d2d400
    ├── 1
    │   └── 4bbed59225358625d11842e1ec069b81
    ├── 2
    │   └── 47c32bbfbc8c08c9047c8a8271893f02

- cache is registered as key, "wiki", which can have 10MB in size at most
- cache will be retired after 1 hour

Please make certain that cache directory does exit.

virtual host
------------

A simple setup to store cache for response of status 200, which lasts 10 minutes.

.. code-block:: nginx

    location / {

        proxy_cache       wiki;
        proxy_cache_valid 200 10m;
    }
