filter packet based upon URI
============================

Wireshark is your good friend.
You can find fun time of examining packets with wireshark.

Sometimes you would like to filter packets and extract packets only for specific URL, say, "www.google.com". Wireshark provides content filter for HTTP as well.

Specify filter as follows.

.. code-block:: bash
    http contains "www.google.com"

`filter manual`_ will help you guide through details of filter configuration.
