===============================

My daughter would like to play her favorite game, minecraft on her ubuntu box.
Here is a short memo to summarize procedure to setup environment to play minecraft on ubuntu.

minecraft client is a jar file and you would better to have hotspot VM.
You can install hotpost VM as follows:

-----------

As with default configuration shared object libjawt.so can not be found.
You have to configure environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that libjawt.so can be searched for.

.. code-block:: bash

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/jre/lib/i386/
