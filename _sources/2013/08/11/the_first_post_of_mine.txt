the first post of mine
======================

A short memo to describe procedure how to host blog on github.

github configuration
--------------------

Let's create public key and private key.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh-keygen 
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    ...

They are yielded under ~/.ssh directory or under current working directory in case that you do not specify its path.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ file *
    id_rsa.github:     PEM RSA private key
    id_rsa.github.pub: OpenSSH RSA public key

Configure ssh so that newly created private key will be applied for access against github.

.. code-block:: bash

    ~/.ssh$ more config 
    Host github.com
        HostName      github.com
        IdentityFile  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.github
        User          git

Deploy public key on github.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.github.pub

Now let's make a test connection to github.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ssh -v -T git@github.com

Let's install git command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install git

Configure user name and e-mail address for github, 

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git config --global user.name <USERNAME>
    $ git config --global user.email <YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>

which will be reflected into .gitconfig file under home directory.

.. code-block:: ini

    [user]
	    name = <USERNAME>
	    email = <YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS>

Enable password cache so as to avoid repetition of password input.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git config --global credential.helper cache
    $ git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'

These configurations will be reflected int .gitconfig file as well.
Or you can write it by hand. (maybe)

.. code-block:: ini

    [credential]
	    helper = cache --timeout=3600

tinkerer configuration
----------------------

You can install tinkerer with pip command.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install tinkerer

This command execution will install dependent modules like sphinx if not there.
The installed version (on ubuntu 13.04) is as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tinker -v
    Tinkerer version 1.2.1

Create local directory to host blog.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir blog

Execute tinker command (not tinkerer) with setup option.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tinker --setup
    Your new blog is almost ready!
    You just need to edit a couple of lines in conf.py
    $ tree .
        .
        ├── _static
        ├── _templates
        │   ├── page.rst
        │   └── post.rst
        ├── conf.py
        ├── drafts
        ├── index.html
        └── master.rst

Configure configuration file, conf.py (same as sphinx's one) according to your appetite.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ diff conf.py.org conf.py
    11c11
    < project = 'My blog'
    ---
    > project = "sakana"
    14c14
    < tagline = 'Add intelligent tagline here'
    ---
    > tagline = 'short memo by SkyHigh71'
    20c20
    < author = 'Winston Smith'
    ---
    > author = 'SkyHigh71'
    23c23
    < copyright = '1984, ' + author
    ---
    > copyright = '2013-, ' + author
    26c26
    < website = 'http://127.0.0.1/blog/html/'
    ---
    > website = 'http://skyhigh71.github.com'

That's all you have to configure upon initial configuration on local side.
And you can modify parameter(s) later on.

Create a new repository named <account.github.io>, e.g.) SkyHigh71.github.io on github.

On the other hand, create local directory to host HTML files for publication.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir publish
    $ cd publish
    $ git init
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/SkyHigh71/SkyHigh71.github.io.git

github URL will be reflected in config file under .git directory.

.. code-block:: ini

    [remote "origin"]
	    url = https://github.com/SkyHigh71/SkyHigh71.github.io.git

Disable jekyll.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ touch .nojekyll

write up a post and publish it
------------------------------

tinker command will create a RST file under YYYY/MM/DD directory:

Start preparation for post frst as draft.
This will create rst file under draft directory.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tinker -d "the First Post of mine"
    $ ls drafts
    the_first_post_of_mine.rst

After having finished editing your post and you are ready to post it, then it's time to post.
Following command will move RST file from draft directory to YYYY/MM/DD directory and be reflected in master.rst file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tinker -p drafts/the_first_post_of_mine.rst

And build it to yield html file. Or you can revert back to draft if you find something needs to be modified.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ LANG=C tinker -b

This will create HTML files under blog/html directory.

Copy files to publish directory and commit it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd publish
    $ rsync -av ../blog/html/ .

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first post"

Finally publish post to github.
By the way, please be noted that you need to select not gh-pages branch but master branch for user's blog.
(It seems that there is a confusion about which branch to choose)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push origin master

Please be patient, as it takes several minutes until posted page will come up.
After a while, you can access your blog with URL of http://<account>.github.io/.
