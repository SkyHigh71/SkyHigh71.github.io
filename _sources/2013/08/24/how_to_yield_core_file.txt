how to yield core file
======================

By default, gdb is given on ubuntu desktop, so you can enjoy debugging applications (if you like :-)).

.. code-block:: bash

    $ which gdb
    /usr/bin/gdb
    $ gdb -v
    GNU gdb (GDB) 7.5.91.20130417-cvs-ubuntu

But it seems that core file of application is not yielded (quite natural).
Here is a memo to describe procedure how to configure system to yield core file.

ulimit
------

Core file size is set to size zero.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ulimit -a
    core file size          (blocks, -c) 0

You can change size to some value by ulimit command. If you would like to set permanently, then configure its value in /etc/security/limits.conf.

.. code-block:: bash

    *               soft    core            unlimited

In this case, soft limit for default entry is set to unlimited.
For details, please refer to man page of limits.conf.


core file pattern
-----------------

By default, application failures will be reported back to developers via `apport`_.

.. _apport: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport

application failure is passed to apport application via pipe as described in /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern file.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
    \|/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c

Therefore you change output location of core file by manipulating core_pattern file.
Following is the sample to configure core files will be yielded under /var/cores directory with file name of core.<executable_name>.<PID>.<timestamp>.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo mkdir /var/cores
    $ sudo chmod a+w /var/cores
    $ sudo bash -c "echo /var/cores/core.%e.%p.%t > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern"

permanent change
----------------

Above change will be lost upon system reboot.
So as to make change reflected over reboot, add following line in /etc/sysctl.conf.

.. code-block:: ini

    kernel.core_pattern=/var/cores/core.%e.%p.%t

Please be noted that apport will overwrite this kernel parameter as follows (/etc/init/apport.conf).

.. code-block:: bash

    echo "\|/usr/share/apport/apport %p %s %c" > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern

This phenomenon seems to have already been discussed in `bug #1080978`_.

.. _bug #1080978: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+bug/1080978

As temporary measure to avoid this overwrite, let us disable apport for now (/etc/default/apport).

.. code-block:: ini

    #enabled=1
    enabled=0

    
summary
-------

Now you will see core files.
Enjoy your debugging life.

By the way, repetition of application failure will consume disk space.
Please be careful and monitor free disk space.
