=================================

language
--------

LANG environment variable of my shell is configured to ja_JP.UTF-8.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo $LANG
    ja_JP.UTF-8

Therefore I first thought that I have to set LANG=C upon building html so as to obtain English output.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ LANG=C tinker -b

*But it's confirmed that language parameter in conf.py is valid for "en" as well.*
**value "en" does not work. You will encounter error stating that "loading translations [en]... locale not available" sorry...**

.. code-block:: python

    language = "en"

And if you would like to configure, say, German as default language of your blog, then configure it as "de".

.. code-block:: python

    language = "de"

But localization is not perfect, for example, date seems to be yielded based upon LANG.
So you would better to set LANG upon building html.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ LANG=de_DE.utf8 tinker -b

theme
-----

You can select theme among following options and set theme in theme in conf.py.

- flat (default)
- modern5
- minimal5
- responsive
- dark

post per page
-------------

Sometimes you find that default post per page (10) seems to be too long.
You can configure post per page by posts_per_page parameter.

.. code-block:: python

    # Number of blog posts per page
    posts_per_page = 3


.. author:: default
.. categories:: none
.. tags:: tinkerer
.. comments::
