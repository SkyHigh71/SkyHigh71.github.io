prevent broken pipe during ssh session
======================================

From time to time, you may encounter ssh session lost with following error.

.. code-block:: bash

    Write failed: Broken pipe

It means that write() system call failed against File Descriptor for socket of ssh session. 

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ man -s2 write
    ...
    EPIPE  fd is connected to a pipe or socket whose reading end is closed.  When this  happens  the  writing
           process  will  also  receive  a SIGPIPE signal.  (Thus, the write return value is seen only if the
           program catches, blocks or ignores this signal.)

You may be able to avoid this connection lost by keeping connection alive.

client
------

You can configure ssh client to send request a response from sshd in the background.
You can set interval with unit in second (~/.ssh/config). 

With following configuration sample, requests are sent every 2 minutes.

.. code-block:: bash

    ServerAliveInterval 120
    
For details, please refer to "man ssh_config".

server
------

Same as client, sshd can be configured to send request on regular basis.
sshd configuraiton file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

.. code-block:: bash

    ClientAliveInterval 120

For details, please refer to "man sshd_config".
